## 🚀 Project Overview

**BGMI Game Analytics** is a data-driven project that applies **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to analyze player performance, matchmaking logic, and leaderboard ranking inspired by **Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI)**.

This project bridges the gap between **DSA concepts** and **real-world gaming systems** such as:
- Leaderboards
- Matchmaking queues
- Player statistics analysis
- Tournament ranking systems
